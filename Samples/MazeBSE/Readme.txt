MazeBSE
-------
Description: simple maze mini-game to show the pathfinder capabilities. A random perfect maze - every point has a path to any other one - is created. The player character is set to the lower left corner of the maze. It's goal is to reach the upper right corner. Many enemy non player characters are set randomly in the maze. Their goal is to catch the player.

TODO
- collision of the player with walls (currently it can cross them)
- dynamics behaviour (currently cursor keys just change it's position)
- helpers/dangers (invisibility, fastest path suggestion, etc)
- better graphics (directx)
